**Airbnb Listings Price Analysis Dashboard**

**Overview**

This project involves the analysis of Airbnb listings data, with a focus on the pricing trends for different properties across various zip codes. Using Tableau, I have created an interactive dashboard to help visualize key insights, such as the average price per bedroom, price by zip code, and revenue trends over time.

**Dataset**

The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from Airbnb Listings. It contains detailed information about various listings, including the number of bedrooms, price per night, and location data, such as zip codes.

**Key Attributes in the Dataset:**

Bedrooms: Number of bedrooms in the listing.

Price: Price of the listing per night.

Zipcode: The location of the property.

Revenue for year: Calculated based on the dataset's available time series data.

**Tableau Dashboard**

The dashboard consists of the following key visualizations:

Average Price per Bedroom: This bar chart visualizes the average price for listings based on the number of bedrooms.

Larger properties with more bedrooms tend to have a higher price per night.

Properties with six bedrooms have the highest average price, followed by five-bedroom properties.

Price per Zipcode (Map View): A map that displays the average price for Airbnb listings across different zip codes, offering a visual representation of how location impacts pricing.

The most expensive listings are concentrated in specific zip codes, providing a geographical perspective on pricing.

Price by Zipcode (Bar Chart): A bar chart that compares the average price of listings across various zip codes, ranked from highest to lowest.

Zip codes 99119 and 99109 have the highest average listing prices, showcasing significant regional price variations.

Revenue for Year (Line Graph): A time series graph showing revenue trends throughout the year.

This graph highlights patterns in revenue generation over the weeks, showing overall growth in bookings over the year.

Distinct Count of Bedroom Listings: A table showing the count of listings based on the number of bedrooms.

This helps to understand the distribution of properties with varying bedroom counts, with a majority being smaller listings (1-2 bedrooms).
